## Spark-O-Stat
SparkCore based WiFi thermostat project

This is my first GitHib project, and the idea is simple.  It's opensource and flexible with a color LCD touchscreen, rotary encoder and speaker to allow room for creative software.  The initial concept will be to control for efficiency by scaling the indoor temperature to outdoor instead of drastic bumps using schedules, and adjustments using predictive code based on experiment and observation.  But all that can be removed and replaced with schedules if desired.
